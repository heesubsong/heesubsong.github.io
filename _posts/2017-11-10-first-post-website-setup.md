After making a few simple sites on github pages to document some of my projects, I wanted to make a site to display them all together. First I learned about the gh-pages interface, then Jekyll, then Liquid, then Sass...

To make my own site, I started with a nice [bootstrap template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/) that was meant for a single-page resume. I took the HTML file, hollowed it out, and turned it into a structure suitable for use with Jekyll. 

Jekyll allowed me to create templates which could be used to dynamically generate HTML pages from content in simple text files, such as [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-downing/r-downing.github.io/master/_posts/2017-11-10-first-post-website-setup.md).
